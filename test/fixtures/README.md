Test fixtures in the following directories are autogenerated:

* `api-model`
* `nodejs-deploy`

To update these test fixtures, follow the instructions for the directory that
you want to update.

## `api-model`

The `api-model` directory contains an API model, `foo.api.json`, that's
generated by [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/). The directory also
contains the source files that are used to generate the API model.

After you make changes to the source files, run the following command to update
the API model:

```sh
npm run update-api-model
```

## `nodejs-deploy`

The `nodejs-deploy` directory contains a snapshot of the
[Cloud Deploy repository](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-deploy)'s
`release-v1.0.0` branch. The snapshot was captured with the following `git
subtree` command:

```sh
git subtree add --prefix test/fixtures/nodejs-deploy \
    https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-deploy.git release-v1.0.0 --squash
```

To update this snapshot, run the following command, replacing `GIT_REF` with a
Git reference such as a branch name, tag name, or commit hash:

```sh
git subtree pull --prefix test/fixtures/nodejs-deploy \
    https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-deploy.git GIT_REF --squash
```
